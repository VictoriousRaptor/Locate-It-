# Locate It!

Tired of finding living metal on your galaxy map? Busy checking your system one by one to find if there's a unfinished stargate?

**This mod helps you locate strategic resources and megastructures. It can mark strategic resources or megastructures in surveyed systems on your map.**

## Usage

1. Just ignore it if you're playing a newgame.
2. If not, then wait for a month or manually input event lcoateit.0 in the console.
3. Open the mod menu in the government tab (top-left corner).
4. Follow the guide in the popup menu. Choose what you wanna locate, *then find it in your situation log, and click "Track all on map"*.

### How to Remove Them from the Situation Log

Just research any related entry. *There is always one on your capital star* in case that you don't have access to any other project.
